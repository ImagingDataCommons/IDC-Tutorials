# Introduction to working with digital pathology images in IDC
This repository contains 
* a short notebook (getting_started_with_digital_pathology.ipynb) giving an idea on how to explore and work with available collections of pathology whole-slide images (WSIs) in the IDC. 
* an notebook (slide_microscopy_metadata_search.ipynb) to introduce the key metadata accompanying IDC slide microscopy images that can be used for subsetting data and building cohorts.
* a notebook (Tutorial_MicroscopyBulkSimpleAnnotations.ipynb) that shows how to work with bulk annotations encoded in DICOM using the example of nuclei annotations. 

More tutorials that show, for example, how to train a tissue classification model can be found in the Github repository [idc-comppath-reproducibility](https://github.com/ImagingDataCommons/idc-comppath-reproducibility) as part of the publication below:
