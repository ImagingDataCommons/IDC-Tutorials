        "\n",
        "[NCI Imaging Data Commons (IDC)](https://imaging.datacommons.cancer.gov) is a cloud-based repository of publicly available cancer imaging data co-located with the analysis and exploration tools and resources. IDC is a node within the broader [NCI Cancer Research Data Commons (CRDC)](https://datacommons.cancer.gov/) infrastructure that provides secure access to a large, comprehensive, and expanding collection of cancer research data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Many datasets on IDC contain images and labels which make them useful for artificial intelligence research.  You can view all available IDC data at https://imaging.datacommons.cancer.gov/explore/. You can interactively identify cases that contain annotations by selecting SEG (Segmentation object) and/or RTSTRUCT (RadioTherapy Structure set) in the Modality section of the search facets on the left.\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook is focused on identifying and retrieving programmatically IDC datasets which have DICOM images and corresponding segmentation labels which could be used to train models for auto-segmentation.\n",

        "\n",
        "Think of IDC as a library. Image files are books, and we have ~45 TB of those. When you go to a library, you want to check out just the books that you want to read. In order to find a book in a large library you need a catalog. \n",
        "\n",
        "In a similar way to the library catalog, IDC maintains a catalog that indexes a variety of metadata fields describing the files we curate. That metadata catalog is accessible in a large database table that you should be using to search and subset the images. Each row in that table corresponds to a file, and includes the location of the file alongside the metadata attributes describing that file.\n",
        "\n",
        "Image files corresponding to the collections hosted by IDC are maintained in the [GCP Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage) buckets. \n",
        "\n",
        "Image catalog is maintained in [GCP BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery) tables. A tiny subset of the attributes indexed in the catalog is available via the [IDC Portal exploration page](https://imaging.datacommons.cancer.gov/explore/).\n",
        "\n",
        "Hosting of both the image files and BigQuery table is sponsored by Google Public Datasets program, you can see IDC entry in the GCP Marketplace here: https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/bigquery-public-data/nci-idc-data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Putting everything together, the process of retrieving the files consists of 2 steps.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Step 1: Define the list of files that need to be downloaded.** This can be done using either the IDC Portal, which provides interactive search interface, or the BigQuery [`dicom_all` table](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?p=bigquery-public-data&d=idc_current&t=dicom_all&page=table) containing DICOM metadata extracted from those files, and accessible via the [standard SQL interface](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/query-syntax). Since this notebook is focused on programmatic access to IDC data, we will focus here on the SQL search interface and not on the capabilities of the IDC portal. `dicom_all` table contains one row per file, and includes column named `gcs_url` which can be used to download the corresponding file.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Step 2: Download the files.** This operation can be done using a variety of approaches that support S3 interface to storage buckets. Most convenient approach is using the [`gsutil` command line tool](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil) from the Google Cloud SDK, or the open source [`s5cmd` tool](https://github.com/peak/s5cmd), which may achieve better performance compared to `gsutil`.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the following cells we will work through some of the main features of the \"IDC catalog\", run some queries to sample data from IDC, and will demonstrate how to download the indexed files.\n",

If you are looking for a conveninent interface to explore the attributes that may be available for the specific image types, but are reluctant to read the DICOM standard directly, [Innolitics DICOM Browser](https://dicom.innolitics.com/ciods) provides a convenient interface for navigating DICOM.\n",

        "One may assume that segmentation series within a DICOM study corresponds to a single imaging series, and may wonder how to find that series. It is important to recognize that in the general case, segmentation may be derived from multiple imaging series, may have different orientation and resolution, and different number of slices.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the cases where segmentation series indeed corresponds to a single imaging series, it may not be easy to identify which one among several within a study. Segmentations can be stored in different objects (SEG vs RTSTRUCT), which in turn have different capabilities to communicate referenced image series. Finally, there are different implementations of the standard, and implementations that are not compliant with the standard.\n",
        "\n",
        "All of that is to say that there is not a single DICOM attribute that can be used to identify the image series corresponding to the segmentation.\n",
        "\n",
        "DICOM SEG encountered in IDC utilizes one of the two mechanisms that can be used to establish correspondence with the series being segmented:\n",
        "1. `ReferencedSeriesSequence[0].SeriesInstanceUID` \n",
        "2. `ReferencedImageSequence`\n",
        "3. `SourceImageSequence`\n",
        "\n",
        "It is also important to appreciate the meaning of the `FrameOfReferenceUID` attribute, which is the unique identifier that can be used to establish whether segmentation (encoded either as SEG or RTSTRUCT) and any image within the study share the same coordinate frame. Strictly speaking, when the standard is implemented correctly, you should be allowed to overlay two series if their `FrameOfReferenceUID` values match.\n",
        "\n",
        "Note that if the reference to a source/referenced DICOM series is present, the semantics of it is that this is the series that was used for segmentation. The segmentation is still expected to be applicable to the other series that share `FrameOfReferenceUID`.\n",
        "\n",
        "Further, strictly speaking, per-frame references to the images used by segmentations are available in the `PerFrameFunctionalGroupsSequence`. However, for the datasets available in IDC, the approach discussed above is sufficient."
