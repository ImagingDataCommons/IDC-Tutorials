        "## What is IDC?\n",
        "\n",
        "NCI Imaging Data Commons (IDC) is a cloud-based environment containing publicly available cancer imaging data co-located with the analysis and exploration tools and resources. IDC is a node within the broader NCI Cancer Research Data Commons (CRDC) infrastructure that provides secure access to a large, comprehensive, and expanding collection of cancer research data.\n",
        "\n",
        "## IDC metadata search: why, what and how\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Think of IDC as a library. Image files are books, and we have ~45 TB of those. When you go to a library, you want to check out just the books that you want to read. In order to find a book in a large library you need a catalog. Without a good catalog it is difficult to make use of a library, or any other resource containing significant amount of information.\n",
        "\n",
        "**What?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Just as in the library, IDC maintains a catalog that indexes a variety of metadata fields describing the files we curate. That metadata catalog is accessible in a large database table that you should be using to search and subset the images. All of the data in IDC is in DICOM format, and DICOM format is all about metadata! A typical DICOM image will contain dozens if not hundreds of attributes describing its content.\n",
        "\n",
        "We extract all of the DICOM attributes, and store the result in a large table, where each row of that table corresponds to a file (and most often, one slice of a CT or MR image corresponds to one DICOM file), and each column corresponds to a metadata attribute. IDC catalog of all the metadata is enormous: as of writing, for IDC release v16, this table contains >42M rows and 869 columns! We will refer to this gigantic catalog as _IDC BigQuery index_ (you can learn how to use this index in another tutorial).\n",
        "\n",
        "The issue is, _IDC BigQuery index_ is very large, requires rather powerful resources to search it, can be intimidating to the novice IDC users, and is not necessary for most common search tasks. This is why we developed a small index of IDC data that contains just a fraction of the metadata attributes. Since this index is small, it can be distributed and searched easily. The downside of course is that you cannot search all of the metadata.\n",
        "\n",
        "We wrapped the IDC \"mini\" index into the `idc-index` python package, which we will be focusing on in this tutorial.\n",
        "\n",
        "**How?**\n",
        "\n",
        "When you search, or _query_ IDC catalog, you specify what criteria should the metadata describing the selected files satisfy.\n",
        "\n",
        "Queries can be as simple as\n",
        "\n",
        "* \"_everything in collection X_\",\n",
        "\n",
        "or as complex as\n",
        "\n",
        "* \"_files corresponding to CT images of female patients that are accompanied by annotations of lung tumors that are larger than 1500 mm^3 in volume_\".\n",
        "\n",
        "Although it would be very nice to just state what you need in free form (and let AI write the query for you - which is becoming more and more feasible - see one such early results in [this preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07637)!), in practice most often queries need to be written in a formal way.\n",
        "\n",
        "To query IDC index, you can utilize Standard Query Language (SQL). You can use SQL with both the IDC BigQuery index, and with the IDC \"mini\" index available in the `idc-index` python package.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the following steps of the tutorial we will use just a few of the attributes (SQL table columns) to get started. You will be able to use the same principles and SQL queries to extend your search criteria to include any of the other attributes indexed by IDC."
