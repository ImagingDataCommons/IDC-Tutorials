Ability to access full metadata makes it possible to define very powerful search criteria to, for example, select images that contain segmentation of a specific organ, or filter by the value of a particular radiomics feature.\n\nDue to the size of the complete IDC metadata, we need special tools that can efficiently perform queries agains this amount of metadata.\n\n[Google BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery) is a serverless cloud-based analytic platform that provides SQL interface to query and analyze large amounts of tabular data.\n\n---\nInitial version: Nov 2022\n\nUpdated: Feb 2026"

IDC is a node within the broader NCI Cancer Research Data Commons (CRDC) infrastructure that provides secure access to a large, comprehensive, and expanding collection of cancer research data."

This \"address\" consists of three components: <project_id>.<dataset_id>.<table_id>\n\n1. `bigquery-public-data` is the ID of a public GCP _project_ that is maintained by Google Public Datasets Program. IDC-curated BigQuery tables with the metadata about IDC images are included in this project.\n2. `idc_current`is a _dataset_ within the `bigquery-public-data` project. Think of BigQuery datasets as containers that are used to organize and control access to the tables within the project.\n3. `dicom_all` is one of the tables within the `idc_current` dataset. As you spend more time learning about IDC, you will hopefully leverage other tables available in that dataset.\n\nIf you now look back at the [BigQuery console](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery) and expand the list of datasets under the `bigquery-public-data` project, you will see that in addition to the `idc_current` dataset there are also datasets `idc_v23`, `idc_v22`, etc all the way to `idc_v1`. Those datasets correspond to the IDC data release versions, with `idc_current` being an alias for the latest version of IDC data.\n\nWe will not spend time discussing how IDC versioning works, but it is important to know that\n\n1. IDC data is versioned;\n2. queries against the `idc_current` dataset are equivalent to the queries against the latest version of IDC data;\n3. if you want the results of the queries to be persistent, write those against `idc_v*` datasets instead of `idc_current`."

For now, you can experiment with this query by adjusting the parameters to select studies that contain combinations of certain modalities (for example, are there imaging studies of liver cancer that contain either MR or CT images and segmentations?). This is probably the most challenging exercise from this tutorial - [BigQuery SQL workspace](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery) should be handy to work on it!"
