    "\n",
    "This notebook is part of [the \"Getting started with IDC\" notebook series](https://github.com/ImagingDataCommons/IDC-Examples/blob/master/notebooks/getting_started) introducing NCI Imaging Data Commons to the users who want to interact with IDC programmatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "In [Part 1](https://github.com/ImagingDataCommons/IDC-Examples/blob/master/notebooks/getting_started/part1_prerequisites.ipynb) of this tutorial series, you learned how to complete the prerequisites that are required to be able to search IDC data. If you have not completed Part 1, it's ok - this notebook is self-contained, and you don't need to go back to Part 1! This notebook continues at the beginner level, guiding you with how to use [`idc-index`](https://github.com/ImagingDataCommons/idc-index), a python package that aims to simplify access to the data available from NCI Imaging Data Commons.\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon completion of this tutorial, you will learn:\n",
    "* how to download images from IDC\n",
    "* how to load and view DICOM images available from IDC\n",
    "* what metadata attributes are available for filtering and how to filter data programmatically\n",
    "* how to better leverage IDC visualization capabilities by programmatically generating viewer URLs for selected items, and embedding the viewer in your notebook\n",
    "* how get the licensing information for the individual files, and how to comply with the attribution usage requirement, which is in place for most of the data in IDC\n",
