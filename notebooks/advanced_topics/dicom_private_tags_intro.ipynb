    "This notebook gives an introduction into how private tags can be used to search IDC content and select cohorts using SQL queries and IDC BigQuery index. Note that this is an advanced topic, and it might be easier for you to tackle this after completing the [\"Getting started\" tutorial series](https://github.com/ImagingDataCommons/IDC-Tutorials/blob/master/notebooks/getting_started/part3_exploring_cohorts.ipynb) that will introduce you to working with IDC using BigQuery index.\n",

    "This notebook was designed and tested in Google Colab. Please use the \"Open in Colab\" button at the top of the notebook to open it in Google Colab. You will need to do extra steps to make it work outside of Google Colab. If you need help with that, please open a thread in IDC Forum: https://discourse.canceridc.dev.\n",

    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Imaging equipment manufacturers, unfortunately, sometimes rely on private elements to communicate some of the acquisition details. Even more unfortunate is that in some cases, information encoded in such private attributes is absolutely essential for interpretation of those images. As an example, key acquisition parameters, such as b-values in Diffusion Weighted MRI (DWI), are stored in private elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is a \"private element\"? This is an element that is not part of the DICOM standard, but instead is specific to a particular vendor.\n",
    "\n",
    "The use of private elements is problematic for a number of reasons:\n",
    "* users need to rely on other sources of information than the DICOM standard (typically, manufacturer DICOM conformance statements) to learn about those attributes\n",
    "* the use of the private elements can change across the software versions\n",
    "* private elements may be removed as part of image de-identification\n",
    "* the specific tag group is not guaranteed to be fixed\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately for IDC users, private DICOM elements are extracted and are searchable in BigQuery (see documentation here https://cloud.google.com/healthcare-api/docs/how-tos/dicom-bigquery-schema#private_data_elements).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we demonstrate how private tags and corresponding data can be accessed using BigQuery on an example of the prostate DWI use case.\n"

    "Private DICOM elements that are not sequences (not DICOM SQ VR) are extracted into the BigQuery column `OtherElements` in the IDC BigQuery index (`bigquery-public-data.idc_current.dicom_all`).\n",
    "\n",
    "First thing to remember is that since private elements are not harmonized across vendors, you will first need to identify the subset of images that you want to analyze, identify the manufacturer and model name for the imaging equipment that produced this specific data, locate DICOM conformance statement and understand how the values of interest are encoded.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the sake of this example, we will look into DWI images that are distributed as part of the [QIN-Prostate-Repeatability collection](http://doi.org/10.7937/K9/TCIA.2018.MR1CKGND). B-value is a key acquisition parameter for DWI.\n",
