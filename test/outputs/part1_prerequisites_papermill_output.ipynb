    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is part of [the \"Getting started with IDC\" series](https://github.com/ImagingDataCommons/IDC-Examples/tree/master/notebooks/getting_started) introducing NCI Imaging Data Commons to the users who want to interact with IDC programmatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook you will learn how to set up your google account to be able to use Google Cloud Platform (GCP), which, along with Amazon AWS buckets, is one the locations from where you can download IDC data.\n",

    "While you can download IDC data from AWS (and you will learn how to do this in part 3 of the tutorial), you do not need to authenticate in order to download data, and it is currently not possible to search IDC data using AWS. In this tutorial we focuse on prerequisites for using GCP, since this is what you will need if you would like to search IDC data programmatically.\n",
